## Planning Story

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer id ornare magna. Curabitur leo arcu, elementum in posuere vitae, rutrum eu urna. Quisque tincidunt nulla sed mi cursus, nec tristique est fermentum. Etiam lacinia id neque ut egestas. Sed consequat convallis felis nec posuere. Sed non eros sed velit viverra tincidunt. Etiam et tortor sit amet lacus volutpat dignissim. Vestibulum convallis, felis a posuere pretium, turpis enim sollicitudin neque, pretium finibus leo metus sed sapien. Praesent iaculis pharetra nunc ac rhoncus. Duis eu risus in est porttitor egestas sit amet eget metus. Maecenas iaculis auctor ullamcorper. Donec pretium dolor non nisl egestas bibendum. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam ullamcorper pulvinar orci interdum mattis. Ut gravida volutpat mauris, a semper risus maximus ut.

### User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to sign up/sign in, change password, and sign out
- As a user, I should be able to create/own a car
- As a user, I should be able to update a car
- As a user, I should be able to view my cars
- As a user, I should be able to delete a car

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript
- AJAX

### Unsolved Problems

- I have yet to organize the way in which the forms appear on the page.
- Would like to eventually use a background that could act as a backdrop for
head on views of the type of users cars that they would like to see. This would
allow the user to see their resource visually on the screen. Also, I had a side
menu bar on the page, but is not currently in use because it is not fully
functional and I would like to implement that.
